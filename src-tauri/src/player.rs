//! The playback engine, and the tick the interface reads it through.
//!
//! The engine itself is `rbl-deck` and knows nothing about Tauri. This is the
//! adapter: it opens the audio device the first time a deck is given something
//! to do, rather than at launch. A library manager that holds an output device
//! for a deck nobody has touched is a library manager that shows up in the
//! system's audio list for no reason; the stream is paused again as soon as
//! neither deck is playing.
//!
//! Position does not come through a command. One event, ten times a second,
//! carries both decks, and the interface extrapolates between ticks from the
//! frame counter. Sixty ticks a second per deck would be pure IPC churn, and
//! the interface would still have to interpolate to draw a smooth playhead.
