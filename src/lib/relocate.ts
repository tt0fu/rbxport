/**
 * Relocate over one track or several, as rekordbox 7.2.19 does it.
 *
 * [OBS rekordbox 7.2.19 macOS arm64, static] The track menu's Relocate
 * (`ListViewer::popupEventRelocateTrack` @0x1003f43e0) and the Missing File
 * Manager's (`MissingFileComponent::buttonClicked` @0x1012a8d50) both run
 * `MissingFileTable::relocateSelectedFiles(…, SearchMode 0, …)`
 * @0x1012a6818 over the selected tracks, in list order:
 *
 * - A track whose file is there is passed over.
 * - The first missing one gets a file chooser (`showFileChooser`
 *   @0x1012a82c0), titled "Choose a new fullpath for : <file name>", showing
 *   files of its extension only, opened where the last chosen file was.
 *   Cancelling ends the whole run.
 * - A chosen file the collection already holds is refused with "This file is
 *   already in the collection." (title "Missing File Manager", OK), and
 *   nothing is written; otherwise the track is pointed at it.
 * - Every later missing track first asks, Yes or No, under the title
 *   "Missing File Manager": "Would you like rekordbox to find other missing
 *   file using the location of this track ?" and, on the next line, the
 *   title of the track just chosen for. Yes looks for that track and every
 *   one after it where the chosen file's move says it would be
 *   (`relocateSelectedFiles` `$_2`, see the backend's `relocate_by_location`),
 *   says "rekordbox found N files." and ends. No opens the chooser for it.
 *
 * The old and new folders the "location" is taken from lose the trailing
 * folder names they share first (`$_1` @0x1012a77b8): a track moved from
 * `/Users/a/Music/X/1.mp3` to `/Volumes/B/Music/X/1.mp3` makes the rest look
 * under `/Volumes/B` for what was under `/Users/a`.
 *
 * rbxport says "RBXport" where rekordbox names itself, as it does elsewhere.
