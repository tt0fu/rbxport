 * window-state plugin does that. This is everything inside it: which playlist
 * was open, how the panes were split, what it was sorted by, which panels were
 * showing.
 *
 * The search box is deliberately absent. Reopening to a filtered library you
 * did not ask for reads as a broken library, and the one keystroke to clear it
 * is not worth that. So is the deck's track: reopening loads it before the
 * library is up, which fails, and the window comes back showing an error over
 * a track nobody asked to hear.
 *
 * Everything stored is checked on the way back in. A playlist can be deleted
 * between runs, a stored width can come from a wider screen, and a hand-edited
 * value can be anything at all; none of those may produce a broken window.
