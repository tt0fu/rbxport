/**
 * The sub-browser: a second, complete browser beside the main one.
 *
 * Not a variant of the main browser — a genuinely independent one, which is
 * how rekordbox stores it. `browseSetting.xml` keeps a whole second
 * `SubTreeLayout` with its own expand state and its own
 * `SubTreeLayoutSelectedPlaylistID`, distinct from the main
 * `TreeLayoutSelectedPlaylistID`. That is what it is for: comparing two
 * playlists, or dragging between them, without losing your place in either.
 *
 * The arrangement is the 2026-09-09 capture's (`docs/screenshots`,
 * `9.09.26 PM`) [OBS]: the main browser narrowed, and beside it a second
 * source rail, a second tree, and a second track list with its own header,
 * search and count, all at the browser's full height. A splitter stands
 * between the main list and the sub-browser's rail, and another between the
 * sub-browser's tree and its list, both clamped the way the main tree's is.
 * The widths are the capture's: 878pt for the whole panel and 298pt for its
 * rail and tree, in a 1798pt window.
 *
 * The capture also shows a Tree View / Column View toggle over both trees,
 * which this app leaves out on purpose — TODO.md records the column view's
 * removal as a choice — so neither tree draws one.
 *
 * The list is a second view in Rust (`specForNode` gives it its own
 * `ViewSpec`, so `useTrackView` opens its own `view_id`), never a copy of
 * the main list's rows; the two share nothing but the library.
