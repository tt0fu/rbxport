/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * What a hot cue pad does when it is pressed, and where the cue lands.
 *
 * The pad has one decision in it — a set slot is called, an empty one is set —
 * and everything else follows from that. The decision is worth a test because
 * getting it the other way round overwrites a cue the DJ set earlier, which is
 * not something an undo would get back: the writer would have soft-deleted the
 * old row. The other half is quantize. With Q on the cue has to land on the
 * grid rather than where the finger was, because every loop and every mix made
 * from that cue inherits the few tens of milliseconds it is off by.
