/**
 * The hot cue pads: set an empty one, call a set one, clear from the list.
 *
 * rekordbox's wording, from `german.lang` and the Export key map: `Set Hot
 * Cue A` (`1`, `2`, `3` for A to C; nothing is bound past C) and `Clear Hot
 * Cue A` (`command + 1`-`3`). A pad is set or it is not, and what a press
 * does follows from that: an empty pad takes the playhead, a set one calls
 * its cue. The HOT CUE list beside the deck has a ✕ per set row.
 *
 * Calling a set pad also starts a stopped deck. rekordbox 7's manual, EXPORT
 * mode "Calling and playing saved hot cue points" (p.102): "Select a hot cue
 * point. Playback starts from the selected hot cue point." The only
 * exception it names is the Gate Cue preference ("Gate playback during Pause
 * (Gate Cue)", p.248), which rbx does not offer, so a call from pause plays
 * and keeps playing [OBS manual].
 *
 * With Q on, a call on a playing deck waits for the beat. rekordbox 7.2.19
 * in EXPORT mode plays on to the next quantize step (at the cue's own place
 * within a step) and jumps there, so the rhythm runs on unbroken: see
 * `quantizedLaunchMs`. This holds with or without BEAT SYNC; a synced deck
 * is on the master's beat already, so the jump keeps it there. Export mode
 * never applies PERFORMANCE mode's "Jump before reaching the next beat"
 * preference, so the wait is the only behaviour it has [OBS static,
 * `PlayerWaveView::updateQuantizeSettings` @0x100c8f10c]. A call inside a
 * playing loop leaves the loop at once and fires at the next step or the
 * loop's old out point, whichever comes first. From pause the call is at
 * once, as is any call with Q off.
 *
 * A set pad is never set over. What rekordbox does with the old row when a
 * slot is filled twice — a soft delete and a new row, or an update in place
 * — has not been recorded [UNKNOWN], so the pad calls rather than replaces,
 * and the writer is never asked to fill an occupied slot.
