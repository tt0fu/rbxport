/**
 * The preview player.
 *
 * Every size here is a token measured off a 2x capture of rekordbox 7.2.11
 * running: the player spans y 56..335pt, its transport column is 80pt wide and
 * its memory panel 209pt, and the five bands inside it (title, overview,
 * phrase, detail, pads) have their measured heights recorded as token sources.
 *
 * Playback is the Rust engine behind the `deck_*` commands — see
 * `usePlayback` and `crates/rbl-deck`. Outside Tauri there is no engine, so
 * the transport is drawn and disabled: a player waiting for a backend, rather
 * than an unfinished panel. Controls with nothing behind them yet are drawn
 * the same way, for the same reason.
