//! Tempo and beat grid.
//!
//! Three stages, each reading the onset envelope rather than the audio:
//!
//! 1. **Candidates.** The autocorrelation of the envelope peaks at the beat
//!    period and at every multiple of it; the Fourier transform of the
//!    envelope peaks at the beat rate and every multiple of *that*. A wrong
//!    period at three halves of the beat correlates (it lands on kick, hat,
//!    kick, hat) but has no spectral line, so scoring a candidate by both
//!    leaves the octave as the only ambiguity, and a tempo prior settles it.
//! 2. **Fit.** The chosen period is refined to a fraction of an envelope
//!    sample by a comb, the phase is found the same way, and then every beat
//!    is snapped to the nearest onset peak and a line is fitted through the
//!    snapped beats. Six hundred beats average a five-millisecond hop down to
//!    a fraction of a millisecond, which is what a grid needs to stay on the
//!    beat for a whole track: 0.05 BPM of error is a beat and a half of drift
//!    by the end of a five-minute track.
//! 3. **Segments.** A tempo is measured in windows along the track, and a
//!    stretch that sustains a different one becomes its own segment with its
//!    own fit, the boundary placed at the beat where the onsets change sides.
//!    DJ edits jump tempo mid-track; a single line through such a track is
//!    wrong on both sides of the jump.
//!
//! The downbeat is not chosen here: every beat comes back numbered from the
//! first, and [`crate::downbeat`] renumbers the grid once it has looked at
//! the music.
