//! The read-only tree a player sees, and the file handles that address it.
//!
//! A player can only reach a node by walking from the mount point, one name
//! at a time, and there are two ways a name resolves:
//!
//! - a node registered up front ([`Vfs::add_file`], [`Vfs::add_dir`]): the
//!   tree the tests and the fake player build, every file named;
//! - a folder allowed as a whole ([`Vfs::allow_folder`]): the library's
//!   folders, `/Volumes/SD/RB` and the like. Nothing under it exists in the
//!   tree until a player asks for it by name; then the host is asked whether
//!   that name is a file or a directory there, and a node is made for it.
//!   The folders above an allowed one resolve only along the way to it.
//!
//! Names are never joined onto a path and re-opened from the root: `.` and
//! `..` are answered from the tree, a name with a separator in it is not a
//! name, and a symlink is not followed, so a player cannot reach outside
//! what was registered or allowed. rekordbox's own file server goes
//! further and exports `/`, resolving every name against the host.
//!
//! Nodes grow while the server runs, so the table is behind a lock; a node's
//! index, and so its handle, never changes once issued.
