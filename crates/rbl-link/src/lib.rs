//! Link export: the library served to players over Pro DJ Link, the way
//! rekordbox serves it.
//!
//! Three servers and a beacon, all measured against rekordbox 7.2.11 and a
//! CDJ-3000 (`docs/pre-release/design-notes/link-export-capture.md`) and
//! built to rekordbox's own join and file service as read out of its
//! binary (`docs/pre-release/rekordbox/link-export-internals.md`): the
//! join and the keep-alive and status packets that put us on the network
//! as `rekordbox` (`join`, `beacon`), the database server a player browses
//! (`rbl-dbserver`, fed by `catalog`), and the NFS server it reads the
//! audio file from (`rbl-nfs`, fed by `files`). `blobs` builds the
//! analysis replies out of the ANLZ files. [`LinkExport::start`] binds all
//! of it; nothing is announced or served until the join hears a player and
//! settles a number; dropping it unbinds.
//!
//! The player's side of the protocol comes from
//! [alphatheta-connect](https://github.com/chrisle/alphatheta-connect-rs):
//! interface discovery, and the status packet that says what a player has
//! loaded. Its remote-database and NFS clients are what the integration
//! tests browse this server with — an implementation that was written
//! against real players, not against this crate.
