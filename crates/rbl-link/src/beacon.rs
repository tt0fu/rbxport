//! Our presence on the link: the packets that put `rekordbox` on a player's
//! source list, and the packets from the players that tell us who is there
//! and what they have loaded.
//!
//! Two sockets, two threads. The announce socket (UDP 50000) broadcasts our
//! keep-alive every 2.0 s and hears everyone else's. The status socket (UDP
//! 50002) broadcasts the mixer-style status every 200 ms, answers a player's
//! media query and its device-settings request, greets a player the first time it
//! reports in, and reads every player's status packet — which is how a
//! track loaded from us is known: the player says so, naming our device
//! number as the track's source. Everything sent is what rekordbox 7.2.11
//! sent a CDJ-3000 (`rbl-prolink`'s tests hold the captured bytes).
