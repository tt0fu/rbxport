//! One track's full record, for the information panel and the deck's INFO tab.
//!
//! A point read by id, on demand. The columnar index in `rbl-index` carries
//! what every row of the track list needs and nothing else; the twenty-odd
//! columns behind the Summary and Info tabs are wanted for one track at a
//! time, and widening the index for them would cost every row in a 38,681
//! track library for the sake of the one being looked at.
//!
//! # What the columns hold
//!
//! Read off the user's own library with
//! `cargo run -p rbl-db --example track_details`, read-only, over all 38,681
//! live rows rather than one:
//!
//! - **`FileType`** follows the extension: 1 is `.mp3` (33,849), 4 `.m4a`
//!   (2,727), 5 `.flac` (56), 11 `.wav` (1,165), 12 `.aiff`/`.aif` (867).
//!   One `.m4a` carries 6 — ALAC or AAC, undetermined.
//! - **`OrgArtistID`, `ComposerID`, `RemixerID`** point into `djmdArtist`,
//!   the same table as `ArtistID`: every one of the 47, 3,118 and 634 set
//!   values resolves there.
//! - **The album artist lives on the album**, `djmdAlbum.AlbumArtistID`, and
//!   that too points into `djmdArtist` (1,591 of 9,785 albums, all resolve).
//! - **`Lyricist`** is a plain text column on the track, not a reference.
//! - **`Subtitle`** holds what the ID3 subtitle frame holds — "extended mix",
//!   "Original Mix", "remastered" on the 479 rows that have one — which is
//!   the field rekordbox labels Mix Name. Read as that; not written, because
//!   no capture shows a non-empty Mix Name to confirm it.
//! - **`HotCueAutoLoad`** is the text `"on"` on all 38,681 rows. What the
//!   unticked box is spelled as has never been seen, so it is not written.
//! - **`DeliveryControl`** is `"on"` on 220 rows, `""` on 825 and NULL on the
//!   rest; **`DeliveryComment`** is never non-empty. These read as the
//!   "Publish track information" box and the "Message" field — the KUVO
//!   delivery pair — and are shown but not written: KUVO publishing is not
//!   a thing this app does, by Chris's word (2026-09-18).
//! - **`DateCreated`** is `YYYY-MM-DD` on every row (length 10, all 38,681).
//! - **`SearchStr`** is NULL on every track and every artist, so an edit that
//!   leaves it alone stales nothing.
