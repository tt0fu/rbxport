//! Guarded writes to the library.
//!
//! # What the shapes are based on
//!
//! Every column value here was read off the user's own library rather than
//! guessed, using `cargo run -p rbl-db --example row_shapes`. The population
//! statistics matter more than any single row:
//!
//! - **A locally-created row has `rb_data_status = 0`.** All 57 playlists and
//!   all 56,376 playlist memberships with `usn IS NULL` — i.e. made on this
//!   machine and never synced — carry 0. The values 256/257/258 seen elsewhere
//!   are written by the cloud sync, not by creation, and 257 is *not* the
//!   folder marker it looks like from two samples: it appears under both
//!   `Attribute` values.
//! - **`usn` stays NULL** until sync assigns one; `rb_local_usn` is ours.
//! - **A soft delete sets `rb_local_deleted = 1` and nothing else** —
//!   `rb_data_status` is unchanged on all 919 deleted rows.
//! - **`TrackNo` is contiguous from 1** in every one of the 683 playlists.
//! - **`Seq` is not**: parents start at 0 or 1, so a new entry appends at
//!   `MAX(Seq) + 1` rather than assuming a base.
//! - **Timestamps are UTC with an explicit `+00:00`**, 1,575 of 1,602.
//!
//! # Cues
//!
//! Cue writing was blocked on three unexplained fields. Counting the
//! reference library's 1,040,598 cues settled all three:
//!
//! - **`ColorTableIndex` is not a per-slot palette.** Index 21 dominates every
//!   hot-cue kind alike — 169,389 of kind 1, 171,149 of kind 2 — so it is the
//!   default colour, not a slot's own. Memory cues carry 0 or NULL.
//! - **`Color`** is 255 on memory cues and -1 on hot ones.
//! - **`BeatLoopSize`** is NULL or 0 on every one of the 1,040,176 cues that
//!   is not a loop; only the 422 loops set it.
//!
//! **`BeatLoopSize` encodes the loop's length in beats** as
//! `(beats << 16) | 1`. Every value in the library fits: 65537, 524289,
//! 1048577, 2097153 and 4194305 are 1, 8, 16, 32 and 64 beats. The one loop
//! whose track is still live carries 262145 — four beats — and its In/Out span
//! measures exactly four beats at the track's own BPM. Zero means the length
//! is implied by In/Out rather than stated.
//!
//! So a plain cue and a loop are both determined. The complete desktop
//! `ColorTableIndex` palette has since been extracted, and memory cues use
//! the eight-value `Color` field, so both kinds can be recoloured safely.
//!
//! # Analysis
//!
//! [`Writer::register_analysis`] writes what rekordbox writes on a track it
//! has analysed, read off the reference library's 38,681 rows rather than a
//! recording: `AnalysisDataPath` derived from the row's `UUID` (38,674 rows),
//! `Analysed = 105` (37,663 rows, and the only value on a row whose files are
//! present), `BPM`, and the `djmdKey` row rekordbox itself uses for the key
//! name. `AnalysisUpdated` (0–10, meaning **[UNKNOWN]**) and the meaning of
//! the individual bits of `Analysed` are still unexplained and are left
//! alone.
//!
//! Recorded on 2026-09-17, rekordbox 7.2.11 loading such a row on a deck for
//! the first time [OBS]: it kept the `.DAT` (our grid), `BPM`, `KeyID` and
//! `Analysed`; rewrote the `.EXT`'s waveform bytes in place (same sections,
//! same sizes, `PQT2` still empty, no `PSSI`); added a `.2EX` (`PWV6`,
//! `PWV7`, `PWVC`) and a `.3EX`; and set `AnalysisUpdated` and
//! `TrackInfoUpdated` from NULL to 1.
//!
//! # What this deliberately will not do
//!
//! `contentCue`/`contentFile` are **not implemented**. Their values are still
//! unexplained, and a wrong one in a 38,681-track collection is not
//! recoverable by undo. See [`Unsupported`].
//! [`Writer::set_analysis`] registers an analysis this app made: the BPM,
//! the key, where the files went, and the length. `Analysed` is a bitfield
//! whose individual bits are not all explained (`analysed_bits`), but its
//! complete compatible value is settled: 105 on 37,652 of the reference
//! library's 38,681 tracks and every sampled row whose files are present;
//! 1 and 17 appeared only on rows whose files were missing [OBS]. The
//! registered-copy test also showed rekordbox accepting 105 without `PSSI`,
//! keeping the RBX-authored grid and generating its remaining files [OBS].
//! A track rekordbox had already analysed keeps any other value it carried.
//!
//! # What this deliberately will not do
//!
//! `contentCue`/`contentFile` are **not implemented**. Their values are still
//! unexplained, and a wrong one in a 38,681-track collection is not
//! recoverable by undo. See [`Unsupported`].
