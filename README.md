# rbxport

rbxport is a music library management app inspired by rekordbox. It keeps its
feature set deliberately small, aiming for a faster, simpler user experience.

Its scope is limited to library management, USB exporting, and PRO DJ LINK.

## Project vision

The core vision of rbxport is **fewer features**.

Because rbxport is open source, you are free to fork it and build a version of
rekordbox customized by the community. The core project does not aim to be that.
A project that keeps adding features eventually becomes what rekordbox already is: full-featured
DJ software. rbxport stays small on purpose. Any contribution that adds a feature
is weighed carefully against this vision, and a good feature can still be
declined.

Two commitments define what "small" must not cost:

- **Compatibility.** rbxport aims to be fully compatible with the current
  version of rekordbox and all the hardware that rekordbox supports.
- **Performance.** rbxport maintains its speed through a performance budget,
  defined in `perf-budgets.json` and enforced by `pnpm budget` and CI. See
  [Development conventions](docs/development/conventions.md).

If you want to propose a feature, read
[Feature proposals](CONTRIBUTING.md#feature-proposals) in the contributing guide
first.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop app | Tauri 2. |
| Frontend | React and TypeScript, with TanStack Virtual for track browsing. |
| Backend | Rust, with independent `rbl-*` crates for library, audio, export, and LINK logic. |
| Database | SQLCipher for rekordbox libraries and OneLibrary USB exports. |
| Build tooling | Vite, pnpm, and Cargo. |
| Testing | Vitest, Playwright, and Rust tests with temporary library fixtures. |

See [Architecture](docs/development/architecture.md) for the repository layout
and how the frontend, desktop shell, and Rust crates fit together.

## Start here

For a first look at the interface, use the browser with a mock library:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev:web
```

This requires Node 24 and pnpm 10.17.1. It does not open an installed rekordbox
library or require a Rust build. For desktop prerequisites and safe library
setup, read [Getting started](docs/development/getting-started.md).

## Developer reading path

Read these in order to understand the project and make your first change:

1. [Getting started](docs/development/getting-started.md): prerequisites, run modes, and library safety.
2. [Architecture](docs/development/architecture.md): repository map, crate responsibilities, IPC, and edit flow.
3. [Development conventions](docs/development/conventions.md): code style, performance, translation, and evidence rules.
4. [Testing](docs/development/testing.md): checks, test setup, and what each result proves.
5. [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md): issues, branches, implementation, validation, and review.
6. [Debugging](docs/development/debugging.md): logs, diagnostics, environment variables, and cleanup.
7. [Releases](docs/development/releases.md): versions, CI, packaging, and publication.

The [documentation index](docs/README.md) also links to user guides and detailed
analysis, USB-format, and hardware references.

## Common commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev:web` | Browser UI with the mock backend. |
| `pnpm dev` | Desktop app; can open your installed library. Read the safety guide first. |
| `pnpm lint` | Frontend lint rules. |
| `pnpm build` | TypeScript check and production frontend bundle. |
| `pnpm test` | Vitest tests. |
| `pnpm e2e` | Playwright browser tests against the mock backend. |
| `RB_LITE_TEST=1 cargo test --workspace` | Rust tests with installed-library writes refused. |
